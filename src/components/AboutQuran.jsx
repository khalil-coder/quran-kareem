Qurʾān, (Arabic: “Recitation”) also spelled Quran and Koran, the sacred scripture of Islam. According to conventional Islamic belief, the Qurʾān was revealed by the Angel Jubreel(A'layhim salam) to the Prophet Muhammad&#65018; in the West Arabian towns Mecca and Medina beginning in 610 and ending with Muhammad&#65018;’s death in 632 CE. The word qurʾān, which occurs already within the Islamic scripture itself (e.g., 9:111 and 75:17–18), is derived from the verb <em>qaraʾa—“to read,” “to recite”</em>—but there is probably also some connection with the Syriac qeryānā, “reading,” used for the recitation of scriptural readings during church services. The Qurʾānic corpus, composed in an early form of Classical Arabic, is traditionally believed to be a literal transcript of God’s speech and to constitute the earthly reproduction of an uncreated and eternal heavenly original, according to the general view referred to in the Qurʾān itself as<em> “The well-preserved tablet” (al-lawḥ al-mahfūẓ; Qurʾān 85:22)."</em></p>
      The Holy Quran is a compilation of the verbal revelations
      given to the Holy Prophet Muhammad&#65018; over a period of twenty three
      years.

       The Holy Quran is the Holy Book or the Scriptures of the Muslims.
      It lays down for them the law and commandments, codes for their social and
      moral behaviour, and contains a comprehensive religious philosophy.
      <p>
      The language of the Quran is Arabic. Besides its proper name, the Quran is
      also known by the following names: <ul className="list-group list-group-flush">

<h5>Form and Content</h5>
The Qurʾān is markedly shorter than even the New Testament, let alone the Hebrew Bible. It is subdivided into 114 chapterlike units called “sūrahs”, <em>Surah Al Baqarah (Ch.2) is the longest Chapter comprising 287
      verses while Surah Al Kauthar (Ch. 108) is the shortest with only four
      verses including the tasmia.</em> The text of the Holy Quran has remained
      unchanged over the past 1400 years. And this is not strange since God says
      in the Holy Quran that He Himself will guard this book: <mark> “Surely it is We
      Who have revealed the Exposition, and surely it is We Who are its
      guardians” (Quran 15:10)</mark>

   <strong> Question:</strong> What Does The Holy Quran Contain To the Muslims?</div> <div className="card-body"><strong>Answer: </strong>The
      Quran is the Word of God and contains complete guidance for mankind. Much
      of the Quran is about God, His attributes and man’s relationship to Him.
      </div>
      </div>
      All sūrahs are traditionally known by names—many of them by more than one—which appear to have emerged only after the death of the Prophet. Sūrah names are usually derived from some conspicuous word in the respective text, such as “The Cow” (the second) or “The Poets” (the 26th), though they do not necessarily identify a text’s main theme. Each sūrah, apart from the ninth, is preceded by the basmalah, the formulaic invocation “In the name of God[Allah], the Merciful, the Compassionate.” Many sūrahs (e.g., the second) are opened by detached Arabic letters, the meaning of which has not yet been satisfactorily explained.

Internally, the sūrahs are subdivided into verses called <em> āyāt (singular āyah)</em>, a word that literally means “sign” and is also used in the Qurʾān to designate manifestations of God’s power and grace, such as miscellaneous aspects of the natural world (e.g., God’s sending down of rain) or the punishments that God is said to have inflicted on sinful peoples of the past. Qurʾānic verse borders are normally defined by the presence of a verse-final rhyme, even though the Islamic tradition transmits conflicting systems of subdividing the Qurʾān into individual verses. <em>The subdivision that is now predominant counts a total of 6,236 verses.</em> These display extreme divergences in length, ranging from only a few words to entire paragraphs of text, but it should be noted that verse length across a given sūrah is tangibly more uniform than across the entire corpus. Unlike classical Arabic poetry, whose beginnings stretch back to pre-Islamic times, Qurʾānic verses do not adhere to a quantitative metre; i.e., they do not conform to fixed patterns of long and short syllables. In this sense, it is correct to insist, with the Islamic tradition, on a principled distinction between Qurʾānic and poetic verses. Many parts of the Qurʾān are highly formulaic, and longer verses often conclude with certain set phrases, such as “God is forgiving, compassionate” or “God is knowing, wise.”

<h5>Qur'ān and Islam</h5>
The Qurʾān forms the bedrock of Islamic law, even though many legal details are derived not from scripture but from extra-Qurʾānic utterances and actions attributed to Hādith of Prophet Muhammad&#65018; - The Sayings of Prophet Muhammad&#65018;. Most of the Qurʾān’s legal or quasi-legal pronouncements are concentrated in a few of the longest sūrahs, the most extensive block of such material being 2:153–283. The domains covered by Qurʾānic law include matters of family law (e.g., inheritance rules), ritual law (e.g., the performance of ablution before prayer or the duty to fast during the month of Ramadan), dietary regulations (e.g., the prohibition of consuming pork or wine), criminal law (e.g., the punishment for theft or for manslaughter), and commercial law (the prohibition of usury).
